		Amortization schedule for a mortgage

This is a Python program which prints out an amortization schedule for a mortgage.
The program should take as input the nominal yearly interest rate r, the amount of the loan P, the number of compounding periods per year m, and the term of the mortgage n in years. 
It assumes that the mortgage is fully redeemed at the end of the term. The program will compute the monthly payment and the effective annual interest rate. 
Furthermore, it displays a detailed payment schedule, i.e., for each month the interest and principal parts of the payment (Second and Third columns of the table), and the remaining principal (the last column).
You can Input the values from a user and It will print out your Amortization Schedule for your Mortgage.
